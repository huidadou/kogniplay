## Next Steps: Import Your Repository

You're on the Vercel dashboard. Here's what to do:

### Step 1: Click "Import Git Repository" (Left Side)

You should see a section on the left that says:
- "Import Git Repository"
- With fields for "Select a Git Namespace" and "Search..."

### Step 2: Install GitHub App (If Needed)

If you see:
- "Install the GitHub application for the accounts you wish to Import from to continue"
- Click the **"Install"** button (with GitHub logo)

This will:
1. Open GitHub authorization
2. Ask you to authorize Vercel
3. Show your repositories

### Step 3: Find Your Repository

After installing, you should see:
- Your GitHub account/organization
- Your repositories listed
- Look for: **`kogniplay`** or **`huidadou/kogniplay`**

### Step 4: Click to Import

1. Click on **`kogniplay`** repository
2. Vercel will show import settings

### Step 5: Configure (Usually Auto-Detected)

Vercel will auto-detect:
- ✅ Framework: Other (static site)
- ✅ Root Directory: `./`
- ✅ Build Command: (leave empty - no build needed)
- ✅ Output Directory: `./`

**Just click "Deploy"!**

### Step 6: Wait for Deployment

- Takes 1-2 minutes
- You'll see build logs
- When done, you'll get a URL like: `https://kogniplay-xxxxx.vercel.app`

### Step 7: Copy Your Vercel URL

After deployment succeeds, copy the URL shown!

## What You'll Get

✅ **Free Vercel URL:** `https://kogniplay-xxxxx.vercel.app`
✅ **API Endpoint:** `https://kogniplay-xxxxx.vercel.app/api/survey`
✅ **Everything works on free plan!**

## After Deployment

Once you have your Vercel URL, we'll update `survey.html` to use it, and you're done!

## Troubleshooting

**"Can't find my repository"**
- Make sure you clicked "Install" for GitHub
- Check that you're logged into the correct GitHub account
- Your repo should be: `huidadou/kogniplay`

**"Build failed"**
- Usually not an issue for static sites
- Check that `vercel.json` is in the repo
- The `api/` folder should be detected automatically

**Need help?**
- Vercel support is great even on free plan
- Or let me know what you see!
